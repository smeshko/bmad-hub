    <action>Execute the enhanced definition-of-done checklist using the validation framework</action>
    <action>Prepare a concise summary in Dev Agent Record → Completion Notes</action>

    <action>Communicate to {user_name} that story implementation is complete and ready for review</action>
    <action>Summarize key accomplishments: story ID, story key, title, key changes made, tests added, files modified</action>
    <action>Provide the story file path and current status (now "Ready for Review")</action>

    <action>Based on {user_skill_level}, ask if user needs any explanations about:
      - What was implemented and how it works
      - Why certain technical decisions were made
      - How to test or verify the changes
      - Any patterns, libraries, or approaches used

    <action>Recommended next steps (flexible based on project setup):
      - Review the implemented story and test the changes

      - Ensure deployment readiness if applicable
      - Run `code-review` workflow for peer review
