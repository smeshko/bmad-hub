IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU FOLLOW THESE STEPS - while staying in character as the current agent persona you may have loaded:

<steps CRITICAL="TRUE">
1. Always LOAD the FULL @.bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/code-review-loop/workflow.md
2. READ its entire contents - this is the autonomous workflow for code review loops
3. Follow the workflow instructions EXACTLY as written
4. This is an AUTONOMOUS workflow - proceed automatically between steps without user interaction
5. Commit after each fix cycle and create PR at the end
</steps>
